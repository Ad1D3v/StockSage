# StockSage

StockSage aims to predict the future movement of the stock value of a financial exchange. The solution employs different Machine learning based predictive techniques to predict stock values. Factors considered are open, close, low, high and volume. We take four different approaches to solve the problem using applications of Machine Learning and some simple analytical techniques. Later, then we evaluate these models/techniques using the RMSE for the predictions made by the models. Then we use the most effective model for further analytical tasks and real-time evaluation of stocks using a web-based framework.
